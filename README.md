[Live](https://gabysantosw.github.io/sticky-notes-firebase/index.html)

## TODO 

- [ ] css grid for the notes 
- [x] use style tag instead of @import for the fonts 
- [x] make footer of note stay at bottom 
- [ ] DELETE FIREBASECONFIG FROM INDEX.HTML BEFORE PUSH
- [ ] remember: main should be DISPLAY NONE while user is accessing 
- [ ] consider placing the button on top of last sticky note instead of it being fixed on left bottom corner

## Learnings 

- Better to use style tag to import the google fonts
